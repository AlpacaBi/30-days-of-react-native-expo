# 30 Days of React Native by Expo

30 days of React Native examples/demos.

This project is inspired by [30 days of React Native](https://github.com/fangwei716/30-days-of-react-native), but over the years, the dependent environment has changed so fast that the original project can no longer run. So I use expo-cli to refactor the project, and use a lot of new features of React(Like hooks)


## 🔎Installation
Require node.js, ```npm install -g expo-cli ```

  1  ```yarn```

  2  ```yarn start```
